# Harvard CS50

:books:Studying computer science

  As a non cs majored junior developer, as continue to learn new things, I realized I am lacking basic fundamentals as a developer. 
Deciding to take an online course, I found out about this amazing computer science lecture from harvard with hard-packed knowledge per 
video and has problem sets that goes along with the lectures. I will be posting notes about the lectures and problem set solution I have come up with. Obviously these are not the best solutions to the problems,
I simply want to share what I have solved.
