# Harvard CS50

:books:Studying computer science

  As a non cs majored junior developer, continuing to learn new things, I realized I lack basic fundamentals as a developer. 
In order to study the fundamentals of programming, I decided to take an online course. Surfing along the web, I found out about this amazing computer science lecture from harvard with hard-packed knowledge for each lecture. Harvard CS50 comes with problem sets that goes along with the lectures. I will be posting notes about the lectures and problem set solution I have come up with. Obviously these are not the best solutions to the problems, I simply want to keep record of what I have studied want to share with other developers.
