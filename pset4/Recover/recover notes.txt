JPEGs
	Each JPEG starts with a distinct header
		First Three bytes: 0xff 0xd8 0xff
		Last byte: 0xe0, ~ 0xef
	JPEGs stored back to back in memory card
	Each blok is 512 bytes

Read Files
	fread(data, size, number, inptr);
	data - pointer to where to store data you are reading
	size - size of each element ot read
	number - number of elements to read
	inptr - file * to read from 

	returns number of items of size size were read
buffer[0] == 0xff?


buffer[3] == 0xe0 ~ 0xef
(buffer[3] & 0xf0) == 0xe0

Making a new jpeg
	Filenames: ###.jpg, starting at 000.jpg
	keep track of how many jpg files found
	sprintf(filename, "%03i.jpg", 2);
	File *img = fopen(filename, "w");

Writing files
	fwrite(data, size, number, outprt);
	data - pointer to bytes that will be writen to file
	size - size of each element to write
	number - number ofo elements to write
	outptr - FILE * to write to 

pseduocode

open memory card
Repeat until end of card:
	Read 512 bytes into a buffer
	If start of new JPEG
		if first JPEG
		  ...
		Else
		  ...
	Else
		if already found JPEG
		  ...
Close any remaining files
